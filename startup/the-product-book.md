## Strategically Understanding a Company
- understanding values, priorities, strengths, weaknesses
- what product are we building?
  - why is your guiding light
  - why people care about what you do and buy into it
  - customers and personas
    - name, details, goal
    - what are the pain points pertinent to them?

    - keep them up to date
  - stays on top of news and climate to see what market adjustments have occurred
  - situational analysis, 5Cs:
    - Company: why does the company exist? how do we know if our product is good?
    - Custmoers: who are the people buying? market segments? how big?
    - Collaborators: external vendors who make the product possible?
    - Competitors: market size, strengths and weaknesses
    - Climate: cultural, regulatory, trends and innovations

## Creating an Opportunity Hypothesis
- you have opinions, not facts
  - focus on validating ideas quickly
- quantitative reasoning as a tool
  - collect data before and after changes
  - careful of data overload
  - ask why the metric is or isn't where you want it to be
    - get to a point where you have a hypothesis
  - feature audit table (how often, and by whom)
  - surveys
  - customer interviews (but last resort and mainly for validation)
- qualitative reasoning
  - bugs
  - feature requests
  - tech debt that provides value down the road
- Business model canvas
  - key partners
  - key activities
  - key resources
  - value propositions
    - for market fit
    - pain relievers, gain creators
  - customer relationships
  - channels
  - customer segments
  - cost structure
  - revenue streams
- Kano model of features
  - basic > performance > excitment
  - they're always flowing backwards because expectations are reset

## Validating your Hypothesis
- SWOT analysis
- user interviews
  - write down a list of assumptions that you have and want to validate
  - instead of asking if they like the product, ask them how they would do certain flows
  - stories are good to get the context of their approach
  - avoid showing prototypes as users get anchored on the new that they see
  - avoid leading or loaded questions
  - pay for interviews with gcs, as it is people's time
  - be quiet and listen
  - clarify vague expressions
  - record if possible to avoid confirmation bias
  - after 15-20, you should be good if you've targeted the expected audience
- A/B testing with metrics
  - can do a concierge style where you manually do the work of the new feature to validate assumptions
  - keep it simple and cheap

## From Idea to action
- most ideas fail because product/market fit is not achieved
- make sure you don't miss a hidden barrier
- write two "imagine the future" documents
  - press release
    - internal stakeholders
    - target market
    - problem addressed
    - how it is solved
    - key features of the solution

    - why they should buy this product instead of a competitors
    - what key aspects would the customer call out

## Working with Design
- design process
  - user research
  - information architecture
  - interaction design
  - prototyping
  - visual design
  - content strategy
- does the design make it easier for a user to use the product?
- never say the product is for everyone
- provide clear requirements, personas, and goals
- Google's Design Sprint
  - Understand
  - Define
  - Diverge
  - Decide
  - Prototype
  - User Testing

## Working with Engineering
- don't bother engineers while they're working unless you have to
- try to understand and don't overstep boundaries
- eliminate technical debt periodically
- for remote teams, overcommunicate
- add milestones for third-party devs to make sure progress is coming along

## Bringing your Product to Market
- understand how selling of your product works
- the clearer the personas, the more targeted the marketing team can research
  - different personas have different sales strategies
  - shortest possible message to appeal to as many personas
- identify a launch group that can support the go-live
  - 1. action items
  - 2. risks and resolutions
  - 3. key design decisions
- identify goal of launch
- identify launch window
- ensure you have feedback mechanisms in place

## Finishing the Product-Development Life Cycle
- CELEBRATE
- give credit
- talk with your lead on feedback with the work
- setting up a retro and don't judge
- review metrics gathered and look to see what's next
