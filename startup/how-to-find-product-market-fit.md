- could take more than 18months
- product market fit is when you have upward traction
- "make something a lot of people want"
- two challenges
  - finding market fit
  - hiring and building world class team
- best companies create the market
  - find a hidden need
  - user testing!
  - better than anything else there when you launch
- listen to people's problems, not their solutions
- rapid prototyping
- prioritizing
  - don't do anything that doesn't bring you to your next milestone
  - optimize for learning
- don't scale above 20+ people unless you have product market fit
- once you found product market fit, scale aggressively because it's a race
