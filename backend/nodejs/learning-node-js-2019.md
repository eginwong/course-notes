# Learning node.js 2019

## The approach
Starting off with perusing udemy, pluralsight, and stack overflow for good node.js resources.

### Udemy
- [Learn and Understand node.js](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/) **** has deep-dive into internals, which is a requirement for understanding
- [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/), I don't like this one because the focus is too heavy on doing and not understanding

### Pluralsight
- [Advanced Node.js](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nodejs-advanced/table-of-contents)

### Stack Overflow
Found an exhaustive list of resources over [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js).
