# Designing for Habitability
[ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSMDJXmOps)

- trust your people
- you build platforms to enable developers, not to inflict them upon them
- don't have all your governance in the tools because you want to allow people to break free of them if necessary
- have a product owner and woo people, we need to design with guardrails in place but devs want to WANT your platform
