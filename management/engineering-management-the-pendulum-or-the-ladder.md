* management is highly interruptive: your job is to be available to your reports while development is about being unavailable to work
* as a manager, your job is to get better at management
  * teaches how the business works
  * how people work
  * having uncomfortable conversations
  * how to resolve conflicts
* management is not a promotion!
* tech lead must connect dots between business and technical
  * break down big objectives into components
  * size up engineers for proper work assignment
  * writing code is not the best use of their time, but herding humans
* the pendulum is going back and forth
* if you're going to be a manager, commit to **two years**
* cannot last as a tech manager as skills deteriorate after 3-5 years
> stop writing code and engineering in the critical path

## Organizational leadership
* good to climb the ladder but less choices and more competition for large companies
* bureaucracies don't always transfer
* your time is not your own, and your failings will ripple
