# A crash course in assembly
[ref](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-assembly/)

- thinking is Arithmetic-logic Unit (ALU)
- short term memory is provided by registers
- longer term memory is the RAM
- sentences in machine code are called instructions
- there is intermediate representation, as another layer in between to reduce extra interfaces
- stuff like C, or C++, or Rust compile into the IR, which then compiles into x86 or ARM
