- name, do I know you or should I?
- company names, do I recognize them?
- job description and history, any warning flags and where have you come from?
- other interests and extracurrics, find something that sets you apart
- tips
  - differentiate, don't annoy
    - try removing all formatting and see if plain-text still conveys
  - don't include a cover letter
  - embrace honest buzzword compliance
  - tell a story, don't use unnecessary jargon
