# The Ego is the Enemy
Ryan Holiday

- Talk drains energy, keep it shut and work
- Be a student and stay humble
- Don't be blinded by your passions. Function function function
- Serve others
- Restrain thyself
- Keep doing what you're doing and stay humble about it, don't let the narrative sway you
- Manage yourself
- The disease of me; serve the goal and the team and don't let yourself get in the way of the innocent climb
- Stay sober and not drunk on your own successes
- Doing the work is enough
