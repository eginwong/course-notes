# The Bullet Journal Method
- Ryder Carroll

## The System
- Index
  - include sections with pages
  - can thread pages too, to include previous instance / next instance
    - 51 / 10 (previous instance) and then (next instance) 160 / 52
- Future Log
- Monthly Log
  - calendar page + tasks page for that month
  - keep entries as hsort as possible
  - when setting up a new monthly log, remember to migrate from Future Log
- Daily Log
- Rapid Logging
- Collections
- Migration
  - often do a monthly migration, when setting up a new monthly log
  - slowly scan all pages of the previous month
    - if you find tasks that are irrelevant, strike them out
    - if they are relevant, migrate them with (>)
    - migrate into a custom collection (>)
    - if task is date-specific and falls outside of current month, migrate into future log (<)
  - book migration, start a new book every year
  - when getting to the end of a book/year, review the Index and see if the Collections + Tasks get migrated
- Bullets
  - things that need to be done (tasks)
  - your experiences (events)
    - unpack experiences as soon as you can
    - events outside of current month go to Future Log
  - information you don't want to forget (notes)

  - Keep emphasis bullets to a minimum


## Tips
- Number your pages
- Basic setup of pages
  - Index: pages 1-4, no empty collections
  - Future Log: pages 5-8
    - divide pages into 6 cells
    - label cells with next months
    - add future tasks + events
    - add to index
  - Monthly Log: pages 9-10
    - title pages with current month
    - list dates and monthly tasks
    - add 9- to your index
  - Daily Log
    - add page number
    - add today's date as the Topic
    - write down today's tasks
    - daily logs don't get indexed  
- Include name and number at the front + key

## Systems
- 5,4,3,2,1 page (personal and professional, one important each)
  - create a new collection for each 
    - break them down into sprints that have fixed length, no barrier to entry, and are composed of tasks
  - for each one, write the what and the why
    - determines scope and milestones
    - ask questions instead of tasks
       - why do I want to do it?
       - what do I want to do?
       - what small thing can I do right now to get started?
- remember iterative development
  - how can I improve tomorrow?
- Gratitude Collection

## Art
- Three Key Sources for Custom Collections
  - Goals
  - Challenges
  - Tasks
- Try to include mission statements
  - I want to [what] so that I can [why] by [how]
    - I want to go on vacation so that I can relax by not being in the office
- Habit trackers for recurring tasks
