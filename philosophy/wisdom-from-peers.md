Question: How do you deal with the feeling that you don't know enough in the world of SWE and feel like you're making little progress in catching up?
i.e., reading SICP, writing a compiler, being functional, being KJJG/MPJ, speaking at conferences, building highly scalable Netflixes, etc?
- But seriously, what I do is accept it. I'm not good at my job because I know a lot. I don't know a lot. I never really have known a lot. I don't come from a Software Engineering background, so I was never the most specialized, and never pretended to be. I try to know enough, and accept that what I don't know I can learn as needed. 
- Book recommendation time. I just recently finished Range by David Epstein. About the benefits of being a generalist. If you look at any one thing others know way more than you. For pretty much any one thing. That's just the nature of working in IT where there is so much out there. But if you know lots of stuff, you can always bring in something even if it's just a unique perspective or the benefit of your lack of smarts. And I mean that seriously, he covers in great detail the big pitfalls specialists face in some tasks like predictions and estimations.
