# Difficult Conversations

- we really have three conversations in one
  - what is it we're actually arguing about
  - my feelings and perceptions of the exchange
  - my identity
- try to lead with feelings and perceptions and change into a learning conversation instead of adversarial
- arguments are not about learning, but about assigning blame to others and getting our word in
- we don't actually have all the answers regarding others' intentions, though we may believe we do
- two takeaways from chapter 3
  - fundamental attribution error
    - don't assume bad intention from bad impact
  - good intention does not absolve bad impact
    - even if you had good intentions, that doesn't mean you get a pass when hurting someone
- chapter 4
  - blame is placing fault at another's feet, and that leads to defensiveness
  - instead, reframe as how both parties contributed to the issue and how to address it in the future
