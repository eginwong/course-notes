# Just Do It, by Art Williams

- be committed
- stay excited for 30+ years or however long until you win
- got to be controversial
- everybody's got a sign that says "make me feel special, make me feel important"
- "I can't" is not
- God's first
  - family is second
  - business third
- the difference between two successful people:
  - pays the price a little bit more
  - works hard and a little bit more
  - loyal to the company a little bit more
  - bleeds and a little bit more
  - saves money and a little bit more
- don't aim to be smart, aim to do things
- just do it
- the winners do it
