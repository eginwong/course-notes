# Mental Models

## Optimization
- hard part is finding the discipline to use them
  - inability to plan for the future is `hyperbolic discounting`
- mental models help **assess how systems work** and help to **make better decisions**
- on tackling questions, we usually go with the easiest direction but not the most important
- world is a patchwork of systems
  - system is anything with parts that depend on each other
    - i.e. process, business, tool, state of being
  - mental model is a reduction to the core features
    - don't reason from analogy (like something else) and use first principles instead
  - questions for first principles
    - what system underlies the activity (relationship, business, product, or other)
    - is the system efficient yet?
    - what are the underlying principles it relies on?
    - can I restart from those principles to identify a better way to run the system?
- local/global
  - repeatedly ask whether you're optimizing a cog instead of the machine itself
- discipline is your obstacle
- flow paralysis (falling into flow) is the archenemey of critical thinking

## How to Make Decisions
- prioritizing, allocating
- regret minimization framework
  - minimize what you would regret not having pursued by the time your'e old and looking back at your life
- Pareto principle - 80% output comes from top 20% of your inputs

## Examples of mental models
- systems are: process, business, machine, state of being
- local/global: identify highest-leverage level to optimize and ask if you're doing that
- theory of constraints: at any time, just one of a system's inputs is constraining is other inputs from achieving a greater total output
  - iteratively identify and address the current constraint
  - i.e. for getting into a hobby, look at input: time, motiviation, knowledge of next steps. Then, optimize for the one constraining
- first principles: discard the system's current approach and re-examine from ground up. Take nothing proven
- (for making decisions)
- regret minimization: long-term decisions, choose whichever option you would most regret when you're older
- pareto's principle: medium-term decisions on ROI, top 20%
- ICE: short-term decisions, score from 1-10 on positive **impact** if it succeeds, **confidence** you have that it will succeed, and how **easy** it would be to try it; average out and prioritize for Expected Value
- Eisenhower Matrix: day-to-day decisions, go with Important/Urgent
