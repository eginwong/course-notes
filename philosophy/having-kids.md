> "I have to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is someone's child!"
> You don't just love them. They become your friends too.
> You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had kids. 
> I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when I write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. 
> I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments, there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it on tap, almost any bedtime.
