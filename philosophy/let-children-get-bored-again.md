> But boredom is something to experience rather than hastily swipe away
> The sooner you learn it's on you to make life interestingm the better off you'll be 
> Every spare moment is to be optimized, maximized, driven toward a goal.
> When you reach your breaking point, boredom teaches you to respond constructively, to make something happen for yourself.
