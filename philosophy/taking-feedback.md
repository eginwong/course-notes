> Everyone has a reason, or an explanation as to why they did something, said something, or acted in a particular way. 
> People who are open to feedback and criticism tend to get more feedback

- What are some of your personal experiences on criticism/feedback?
- How do you give feedback/criticism and how might that be improved upon?
- Which basics resonate with you? Why?
  - Anyone who has feedback for you is worth hearing out.
  - Donâ€™t defend yourself, try to understand their perspective instead (perceptions are reality after all).
  - Listen. Listen. Listen.
  - Reflect and try to figure out what you can learn and how you can improve (even if it is only your interactions with that individual).
  - Tell them thank you for sharing their opinion with you.  That way you know they will continue to do so!
