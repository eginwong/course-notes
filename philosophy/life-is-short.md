> And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience.
> But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own.
> Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.
