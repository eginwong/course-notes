# Lunch and Learn on Functional Oriented Architecture

## What does that even mean?

## Where do we commonly see Functional Programming? Is this related to Functional Programming?

## FOA, case study with client

Major source of inspiration, talk on functional paradigm for architecture

## Compare with SOA and OOA and FOA
[SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)

[Multi-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)

[OOA](https://www.tutorialride.com/software-architecture-and-design/object-oriented-architecture.htm)

microservices, service oriented, monolithic, layered, event-driven, component-based, peer-to-peer (networking), data-centric, client-server

## Flow
1. discuss various types of architecture, progression through age and use case
2. discuss what functional oriented architecture is
   1. compare with functional programming 
   2. function-flow pattern?
   3. this section will be long
3. Show crazy diagram, Module Stereotypes
4. Talk about the tools required to support some enterprise architecture like this
5. Talk about process and how this came about
6. Talk about real-life use case and when and how to use this
