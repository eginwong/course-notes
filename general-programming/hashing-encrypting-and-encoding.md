## Terminology
- hash function: calculates a deterministic, irreversible, fixed-size alphanumeric string
- digest: hexidecimal output generated by a hash function (checksum, or fingerprint)

## Hashing vs Encryption
- hashing provides integrity
- encryption provides confidentiality
- public key cryptography uses RSA (slow but secure) for communicating securely while internall using AES (faster, less secure) for encrypting data with a shared key, using a hash function for message digest to verify integrity of payload sent/received
- message auth involes hashing message to produce digest, encrypting it with private key to produce a digital signature

## Base64 Encoding
- taking binary data -> text-based format
- converts binary into text to inline when needed, as only supports textual data
- takes 3 bytes and represents them as four printable characterse in ASCII

## MAC vs HMAC
- Message Authentication Code uses symmetrical cryptography with an encryption algo to verify integrity of message while HMAC (SHA256) will use a hash function internally instead of an encryption algo
- can take the hmac value, then convert hexadecimal output into binary and then base64 encode that

## Random Password Generation
- `pwgen`

## OpenSSH
- best to move keys to `~/.ssh` directory

## OpenSSL
- designed to provide a method for securing web-based communications (HTTPS/SSL/TLS)
- RSA and Diffie-Hellman as key exchange algos
