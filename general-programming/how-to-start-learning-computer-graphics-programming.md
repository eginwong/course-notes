# How to Start Learning Computer Graphics Programming
[ref](https://erkaman.github.io/posts/beginner_computer_graphics.html)

1. Start with Raytracing and Rasterization
   -  raytracer renders 3D scenes by sending out rays from every pixel in the screen, w/calculations to figure out final colours of each pixel
   -  software rasterizer renders 3D scenes, much faster than raytracing
