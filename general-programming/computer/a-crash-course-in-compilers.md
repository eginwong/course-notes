# A Crash Course in Compilers
[ref](https://increment.com/programming-languages/crash-course-in-compilers/)

- programming language is a formal language used to communicate instructions to a computer
- any Turing complete machine/language can implement any computable algorithm
  - generally any notion of state (variables/argument passing) and conditionals
- computer programs are typically used to feed code to produce an effect
  - compilers
    - translate source code into a target code with the same meaning
    - goes through several phases as pipe transformations
    - parsing
      - Lisp reading
        - code is data and vice versa, language syntax constructed entirely out of data structures
      - scanning/parsing
        - new languages are more complicated
        - scanner (lexical analyzer) reads source text and produces a stream of tokens
        - parser reads the tokens to transform into nodes in an AST
    - analysis
      - AST - what did the user mean?
      - semantics
      - name resolution, control flow, function invocation
    - emission
      - most will use the LLVM toolchain
        - unifies hardware platforms and optimizations under one target
      - targeting the IR (intermediate representation) that a compiler would emit allows for further optimizations written in C/C++ for free
      - LLVM exposes C++ and C API to generate IR
    - tooling and ecosystems
  - interpreters
    - take source code and immediately implement its effects
    - simple
    - execute faster than compilers
    - ability to run in environments where compiling new code is prohibited
