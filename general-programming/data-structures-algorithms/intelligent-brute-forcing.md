[ref](https://davidkoloski.me/blog/intelligent-brute-forcing/)

- begin with a working solution and get benchmarks in quickly
- small quickfixes
  - hashmap for memoization
  - ordering state to reduce entropy
  - better algorithms (A* in this case)
  - consider reducing data structure if you know the determined quantity
  - can start with larger initializations of important data structures
