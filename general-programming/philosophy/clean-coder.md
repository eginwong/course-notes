# Clean Coder

## Professionalism
- Take Responsibility
- First, Do No Harm 
  - know that it works
  - QA should find nothing
- Work Ehtic
  - 60 hours, 40 hours for work, 20 hours for yourself
  - identify with your client
- Know your domain
- Be humble

## Saying No
- Adversarial Roles
  - be truthful and stick to your chops
- High Stakes
  - when you need to stick to your chops
- Being a Team Player
  - make sure you're repping your team and not just yourself
- The Cost of Saying Yes
  - don't kill yourself
- Code Impossible

## Saying Yes
- say something, mean it, and do it
- recognize lack of commitment
- can only commit to things that you have full control over
- be creative to find solutions but do not over commit what you don't have

## Coding
- must work, integrate, readable, align to customer needs
- arguably avoid going into the Zone because you need to think critically
- reduce debugging time to zero as best as possible through TDD
- walk away when you need to
- ask for help and accept help and offer help

## TDD
- do it, it's proven
- written first, they are offense and define functionality
- written after, they are defense and you will never know if you protected the functionality

## Practicing
- practice katas
- learn different skills off work

## Acceptance Testing
- requirements change
- clients don't know what they want until it's coded out
- required for specifying what the system does
  - written by the business for the business
- decouple the GUI tests from the API/business level tests
- acceptance tests are a contract between delivery and stakeholders

## Testing Strategies
- QA to write the corner and edge cases
- Business to write happy path
- unit tests are for lower-level + corner cases
- integration tests are for plumbing
- system tests go for performance and throughput cases

## Time Management
- meetings are necessary and time wasters
  - actively resist meetings that don't have an immediate and significant benefit
- person inviting you to a meeting isn't responsible for managing your time, only you can do that
- a good manager will block your time from the meeting when appropriate
- leave when the meeting is no longer relevant
- keep retros and demos to 45 min together
- any argument that can't be settled in 5 minutes can't be settled by arguing
  - not enough evidence on either side
  - get either side to present for 5 min and then vote
- only finite resources for concentration so use them wisely
  - sleep
  - cafeeine
  - recharging 
  - good input (reading) to output (writing code) 

## Estimation
- PERT model for approximations
- Optimistic + 4 Normal + Pessimistic / 6 = expected duration of the task
- devs see in probability distributions

## Pressure
- avoiding pressure
  - don't commit to impossible things
  - staying clean
- handling pressure
  - don't stress
  - communicate
  - rely on disciplines

## Collaboration
- avoid owned code
- pair program

## Teams and Projects
- good teams are hard to build, so keep the team and change the projects

## Mentoring, Apprenticeship, and Craftsmanship
- mentors are important
- be a craftsman
