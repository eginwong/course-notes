[ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkYDsiRVqno&feature=youtu.be&t=272)

- over generalization
  - where people so commonality everywhere
- the disillusioned developer
- the enthusiastic architect
- the disillusioned architect
- the "wise" architect
  - it depends
  - generic thing machine
  - unhealthy complexity attraction
- innovation addiction
- severe tunneling fixation
  - for people who already know a language and shoehorn everything into that understanding
- asset addiction
  - hammer to apply to all nails
  - forcing a framework/tool/library into all problems
- exaggerated risk aversion
  - sticking to the the same terrible for too long
  - simple easy complex hard
- impact dissonance
  - too attached to the system and thinking you're the bottleneck
  - get off the critical path
- architects should
  - sales 30%
  - do technical stuff 5%
  - defend architecture 30%
  - try to be involved 35%
- to get better
  - have some dogma and rules
  - have experience
  - being pragmatic
  - minimalism
  - trends and future needs
  - experiments and POCs
  - hands-on participation
