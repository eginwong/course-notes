# AZ-500 Sample Questions
- new stored access policies immediately revoke all tied to them beforehand
- to connect Azure HDInsight cluster for hybrid AAD, need VNET, custom DNS server in Vnet, attach both, then configure forwarding between custom DNS and on-premise DNS
  - can also allow through VPN
- Synchronization Rules editor can filter out certain AD accounts from being synced
- risks
  - leaked = high
  - sign-ins from anonymous ip + atypical travel + suspicious activity + unfamiliar = medium
  - infected devices = low
- create access review program, then a control, and then group owners
- if members can review themselves, they are the only ones who can
- to sign up for PIM
  - consent to PIM, verify with MFA, sign up PIM for AAD roles
- MFA enabled means pending registration but it is still required
- Azure blueprints can be used to have same role assignments across subscriptions
- ACR push can also pull images
- to use custom domain name, requires app service plan to be non-free (scale up)
- Azure Connect configuration requires global admin in AAD and enterprise admin in AD
- hybrid AAD means AD with password authN to minimize auth for SQL db, not integrated auth because that is for federation
- dynamically construct resource ID for key vault through Parameter file
  - the template calls the parameters file
- if outside of conditional access policy, must use MFA
- can transfer subscriptions between AAD tenants only
- deployifnotexists, template
- updates are OS-specific
- data plane: key vault access policy
- management plane: RBAC
- ADE requires standard tier level VMs and must be an IaaS VMs, so not A
- Log Analytics not limited by RG or region now
- AKS ingress controller handles TLS termination + RP + traffic routing
- Antimalware can be added to VMs using an extension 
- ASG can only be applied to within the same VNET
- custom sensitive information type to create a custom sensitivity label
- Security Playbook will use the Azure Logic Apps Designer 
- custom alerts require a storage account + workspace; but would use Azure Sentinel instead, which relies on a Log Analytics Workspace
- need workspace id and key
- adding a tag is not an administrative option
- computer group -> scope config -> apply config
- to receive network traffic, use nsg flow logs and azure network watcher
- Auto Provisioning turns on Log Analytics Agent for all supported VMs
- OAuth 2 requires redirect URI for implicit grant type
- DeployIfNotExists policy requires managed identity
- create a role to access secret1 from the app
- to rotate keys from within Azure Automation, create the account + import PS modules + connection resource in the AA account
- last condition is the most sensitive and applies first
- create AKV -> access policies for AKV -> Set disk encryption
- Access policy for ADE 
- a secret in KV can allow access to db for a contained db user
- need to be global admin to enable PIM
- dynamic membership, string and regex operations are not case-sensitive
- JIT access not available with free tier of azure security center
- if exclusively to an RG, need create a managed identity setting
  - but should be scope if exclusive
- create server, client, AKS, RBAC binding
- traffic allowed by default without NSG
- if in a different vnet, cannot ping through the internet
- upgrade security center tier to standard for custom OS security config
- for mutual, requires TLS1.2
- managed disks in storage accounts, with subscriptions being the assignable scope
- for AAD AuthN in SQL Server, need to connect SSMS, create contained db users, and then system-assigned managed identity
- diagnostic logs stored in SA, retrieve through AzCopy
- workspace first for alerts
- unattended tests can be done through .webtest file in App Insights
