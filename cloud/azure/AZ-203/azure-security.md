# Azure SecurityÂ´

- 10-15% on the AZ-203 exam
- implement authentication
  - using certs, forms-based auth, or tokens
  - multi-factor or Windows auth by Azure AD
  - OAuth2 auth
  - implement Managed Service Identity (MSI)/Service Principal authentication
- Authentication is act of challenging a party for legitimate credential, providing the basis for creation of a **security principal** to be used for identity and access control
  - knowing the identity of the user
- Certificate-based authentication (trusted apps or Microsoft Apps)
  - eliminates need to enter a username/password for certain Microsoft Office apps on your mobile device
- Forms-based Authentication
  - uses an HTML form to send the user's credentials to the server
  - easy to implement, built-in to ASP.NET
  - requires a browser, not standard HTTP auth mechanism and uses HTTP cookies instead, CSRF, credentials sent as plain-text, some users disable cookies
- Azure Active Directory
  - fully managed multi-tenant service from Microsoft that offers identity and access capabilities for apps running in Microsoft Azure
- Application Model (things we must support)
  - identify app according to the authentication protocols it supports
  - handle user consent during token request
- What's inside the token?
  - Claims!
  - validate the token, identify subject's directory tenant, user information, ...
- [sample](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet)
  - create azure ad
  - create new app registration
    - name, app type, sign-on url
  - visual studio, can publish from the Build dropdown
  - azure, have to change the app to "multi-tenanted" from the app > settings > properties 
  - get the azure AD url (as the domain) from the Azure Active Directory tab
  - need to add a new user with AD Url as domain of the user
  - claims are sensitive information so you should not share that
- multi-tenant, yes, no, needs to be set "yes" to allow cross-domain (i.e. one is on.microsoft.com, the other is .azurewebsites.com)
- multi-factor authentication
  - knowledge (pwd)
  - possession (phone)
  - inherence ()

# Azure Security, part II
- Service principal authentication (accounts run by apps and not by people)
- RBAC, role-based access control
  - role (reader, resource-specific or custom role, contributor, owner) by scope (subscription, resource group, resource)
- flow
  - security principal (user, group, service principal, managed identity)
  - role definition
    - roles will have a set of actions/not-actions defined
      - built-in and custom  
  - scope (group of resources on which these actions are applied)
- can do multiple role assignment
- select item that you want to grant access control to, and then access control (IAM) > role assignments 
- shared access signatures (SAS)
  - provide you with a way to grant limited access to objects in your storage account to other clients
  - service SAS
  - account SAS
  - no need to create portal account
- TODO: CBAC
- encryption models
  - client-side
  - server-side
  - must enable "secure transfer required" option in the Storage Account > Configuration
    - does not work from custom domain
- encryption of SQL databases
- transparent data encryption is managed

# Azure Key Vault
- secrets management
- key management
- cert mgmt
- store secrets backed by hardware security modules
