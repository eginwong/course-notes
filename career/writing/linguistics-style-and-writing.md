@reread

- minimize apologies
- don't tell me what you're going to do, tell me what you're doing it about
- minimize hedging
  - somewhat, comparably, virtually
- CLASSIC PROSE:
  - better to be clear and possibly wrong then muddy and "not even wrong"
  - keep the illusion that reader is seeing the world rather than reading verbiage
  - about the world, not the tools we use to understand the world
    - approach, assumption, concept, condition, paradigm, process, perspective, variable
- passive voice is okay, remember
  - job of writer is to tailor information in a way that reader can most easiestly consume
- problem
  - professional narcissism
  - curse of knowledge is the chief reason why writers be bad
- solution
  - show a draft to a representational reader
  - show a draft to yourself after some time has passed
