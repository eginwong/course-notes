## Tutorials
- lessons through a series of steps to complete a project
  - learning oriented
- MUST:
  - show user they can do something meaningful and attainable
  - be practical knowledge
  - be able to give the user a starting point for how to use the documentation
  - learn
- the exercise must be
  - meaningful (sense of achievement)
  - successful (complete it)
  - logical (makes sense)
  - usefully complete (encounters all actions and concepts they need to be come familiar with)
- meta:
  - hard to do
  - much work to maintain
- the user must
  - gain confidence and want to do it again
  - not about what they do
  - learn at their own pace in their own time THROUGH activities done together
- writing a good tutorial
  - don't try to teach
    - they only learn by doing
  - get the user started
    - **not a manual for best practice but a way to begin**
  - provide a complete picture before they start
    - let the user form an idea of what they will achieve from the start
    - > In this tutorial, you will be a X using X and deploy it using Y. You will ...
  - ensure the tutorial works reliably
    - confidence is built slowly, and is easily shaken
  - ensure user sees results immediately
    - as far as possible, every action should be evident, cause and effect obvious
  - repeatable
    - tutorial should work all the time for all users
  - describe concrete steps
    - be specific and particular. 
    - do not introduce abstraction
  - offer minimum necessary explanation
    - if they don't need it, don't share it
  - ignore options and alternatives
    - get it done, keep tutorial short and crisp


## How-to Guides
- goal-oriented
- directions to solve a real-world problem
- recipes to guide users to a **specific** end
- helps to frame what your product can do
- not the same as tutorials
- tips
  - describe a sequence of actions, with order
    - does not need to repeatable
  - solve a problem
  - don't explain concepts
    - ACTIONS
  - be flexible
  - omit the unnecessary
    - practicality > completeness
    - reader has to do some of the work
  - choose good titles explaining what it does
    - "How to integrate application performance monitoring"

## Reference
- technical descriptions, information-oriented
- describe succinctly, orderly
  - users need truth and certainty
  - austere, to the point
    - we don't read it, we consult it
- often needs to include description of how something works or correct way to use it
- can auto-generate if possible
- sections of reference should align with architecture of software, if possible
- be consistent
  - with tone, structure, language, terminology
- do nothing but describe, accurately, clearly, comprehensively
  - do not include instruction or explanation, link instead
- provide examples
- be accurate

## Explanation
- discussion that illuminates particular topic, understanding-oriented
- doesn't care what the user is doing, from a higher perspective
- think of the why question to serve as boundary
- Make connections
- provide context and background
- talk about the subject (e.g., about user policy, etc.)
- discuss alternatives or opinions
- don't instruct or provide technical reference

## Meta Diataxis
- system for structuring documentation
  - but also for guiding and assessing quality of work
