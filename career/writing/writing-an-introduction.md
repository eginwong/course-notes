Julian Shapiro

- choose your topic
  - write about the topic that you *can't not* write about
  - choose an objective
    - open people's eyes by proving status quo is wrong
    - cut through the noise and articulate something everyone is thinking but no one is saying
    - identify key trends on a topic and predict the future
    - contribute original insights through research and experimentation
    - distill an overwhelming topic into something approproachable
    - share a solution to a tough problem
    - tell a suspenseful and emotional story that imparts a lesson
  - pair the objective with motivation
    - does writing this article get something off your chest?
    - does it help reason through a nagging, unsolved problem you have?
    - does it persuade others to do something you believe is important?
    - do you obsess over the topic and want to share the geekiness to others?
- introductions with a twist, hook your readers into reading more
  - as long as you fulfill the hook
  - hook: half-told story
    - pose an intriguing question without the answer
    - share the beginning of the narrative but withhold conclusion
    - highlight new findings, but only a portion
    - present your case but not how you arrived at it
  - hooks tease your best talking points
  - generate hooks by finding questions you want answers to:
    - what is the most captivating questions they could pose to make me excited to read this?
    - write those questions down, even if you lack the answers
    - rank your questions by how much they interest you
    - top questions become your hooks and put them in your intro without the answers
  - > Your questions donâ€™t have to be mind-blowingly interesting. They just have to be good enough for your target audience to keep reading.
  - the answer to the hook will be an idea you explore in your article
  - hooks show you what a job well done looks like
  - ask for feedback after the intro, to know if people actually want to know your content
- combatting skepticism
  - superficial: readers don't believe you'll share things they don't already know
    - tease your original insights in your intro
  - irrelevant: readers don't believe you'll cover key points they care about
    - list the points you'll cover
  - sloppy: don't want to sit through more bad writing
    - rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing
  - implausible: don't believe you'll answer your hooks well
    - make your hooks realistic
  - untrustworthy: don't believe you're qualified to write about your topic
    - share if you have relevant credentials and win them over!
- feedback
  - rate from 1-10, and ask what sort of questions they want to answer if they were writing about the topic
  - re-write until you get an average 8/10
  - don't chase perfection
