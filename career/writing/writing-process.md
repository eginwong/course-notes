# Writing Process
[ref](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/first-draft-writing-process)

- first draft is for generating ideas
  - brainstorm talking points
  - connect dots between those points to learn what you're *really* trying to say
  - write the first draft for yourself, the second one for everyone else
- start with your objective
  - from the previous article
  - reveals what must be accomplished to succeed in your goal
- every argument has two types of talking points
  - supporting points: which points are needed to make my argument
  - resulting points: what are the implications of my argument being true?
- the first draft process:
  - choose an objective
  - write a messy braindump of your ideas
  - transfer best talking points to outline
  - write first draft using that outline
- ideas come from
  - hooks, experience, research, experiments, brainstorming, mental models
  - focus on interesting or surprising ideas
  - skip everything that bores you
  - > writing for yourself is the quickest path to writing something others love
  - when stuck: 
    - how can I make my point more convincing?
    - what are the interesting implications of what I just said?
- outline your talking points
  - supporting points set the stage for your argument, resulting points explore what happens when your argument is true
- write a draft using your outline
  - let the flow of your argument naturally reshape your outline
- writing an outro
  - optional
  - frame why your article was worth reading
    - share a poignant takeaway
      - make readers think - I should memorize this one-liner of advice
    - provide next steps
      - what next?
