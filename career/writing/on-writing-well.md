# On Writing Well
[ref] Book

## Important qualities:
- Humanity and warmth
- Achieve greatest clarity and strength through words
- Clear thinking becomes clear writing
- Examine every word you put down and realize a lot don't belong
- Simplify, bracket words and verbs that may be removable 
- Write with I in mind, because that is where your style comes from. Be yourself. And if necessary, remove I.
- Go out on a limb and say something. Writing is an act of ego, so own it 
- Write yourself
- Never write anything that you wouldn't say (individual, furthermore, indeed, etc.)
- Be picky with words and cognizant of cliches being overused 
- Use dictionary and thesaurus well 
- E.B.White is a good reference for writing

## Methods
- Unity is key to good writing, stick in one mood, tense, and one goal
- Use active verbs, passive ones suck (saw vs. was seen)
- Use precise verbs to give more flavour and impact 
- Avoid adverbs, unless they do work
- Same with adjectives
- Avoid little qualifiers (a bit, a little, sort of, kind of, somewhat, very, rather, quite, in a sense)

## Punctuation 
- Use periods quickly and often.
- Exclamation points are rarely needed. Let the reader discover the humour on their own as an understatement
- Use dashes to explain thought one with thought two

## Mood changers
- Alert your users: nevertheless, however, but, yet 
- Start sentences with but. However is weaker
- Always ask yourself where the reader is at that point: now, later, today, meanwhile
- Contractions: don't use (I'd) because ambiguous if it's had or would. Also, don't invent contractions.
- That and which, use that generally and which when you need a comma
- Don't use abstract nouns; sentences need people and verbs
- Don't overstate and blow things out of proportion 
- Keep paragraphs short but vary
- Trust your material and don't over explain (avoid judging content by using, of course, predictably, surprisingly)
- Write about what you're passionate about; it's the connection that will draw people

## FORMS
- For nonfiction, interview people that are related to some corner of your readers life 
- Intro: explain why they are worth writing about, and make sure to WRITE the notes
Don't lead into a quotation but start off with it instead. That is stronger 

## LOCATION
- write about what's different and strikes your senses

## MEMOIR
- write about the people, ultimately how it changed you and affected you, your own personal take on things

## CRITICISM
- have an opinion and stick to it 

## ATTITUDES
- be as precise as possible in language, no cliches
- Choose words carefully
- Plain nouns are powerful
- Show your enjoyment as a writer, the reader should be able to see it

## ORGANIZATION
- the hook has to be linear and lead the reader thoughtfully. avoid commas and keep to one thought sentences.
