# The Written Word

[ref](https://collabfund.com/blog/the-written-word/)

- stories are always helpful for ideas
- people don't remember books, they remember sentences
  - have memorable onesf
- writing is about efficiency, how to say the most in the fewest words
  - but not brief
  - every line is a delight to read, that's efficiency
- don't build up to the point and make it a slog. Each sentence should be just as interesting as the big idea
  - short sections are also nice because it provides a feeling of progress
