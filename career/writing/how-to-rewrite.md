[ref](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/editing-and-style)

- pursue four new objectives:
  - clarity
  - succinctness
  - intrigue
  - logic
- clarity
  - is writing what readers can follow
  - tools:
    - simple sentences
      - write as if to a child, but be clear and logical
      - don't lose the "why"
      - use fewer ideas per sentence
      - red flags are "in other words", "that is to say", "put another way"
    - examples and counterexamples
      - provide before and after examples; helps orient readers to know right from wrong
      - don't waste time with examples if confident that point was self-evident
- succinctness
  - remove everything that is not required to make your point
  - it is a ratio
  - cannot be compressed any further
  - tools:
    - read all paragraphs, take an hour-long break, rewrite section from memory with only key points
    - go through each sentence in your rewrite and remove filler words
    - then rephrase the last piece as succinctly as possible
- intrigue
  - insights and surprises
  - have a captivating intro that buys goodwill
  - then have at least one peak of insight or surprise
  - have an ending that justifies why the piece was worth reading
  - get feedback by getting people to highlight sentences they thought were interesting. Rewrite sections that have low numbers and get a steady cadence for long writing
- on feedback
  - if 3/10 people have same feedback, make the change if quick
  - if 4/10 have same feedback and you disagree, you're wrong and go fix it
- write with your own voice and style
  - tone of voice, humor, eccentricities, viewpoints
  - authenticity
  - inauthenticity

Feedback Section

Could you score this from 1-10 on how satisfied you were after reading it?

Don’t be afraid to give me a low score. The more people tell me this isn't good yet, the more I'm motivated to make it even better. 

Also, feel free to point out problems with:

Logic — What didn’t you agree with?
Clarity — What was unclear?
Interest — What bored you?
Brevity — What unnecessary things should be removed?
Expansion — What unanswered questions were you left with?
