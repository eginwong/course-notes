# Resonate
Nancy Duarte

- Stories resonate with people
- You are not the hero
  - (don't write about us, what you're all about)
  - make it about the audience

[Ben Zander's talk on Music](https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_the_transformative_power_of_classical_music?language=en#t-1227079)

## Follow a story
- Short beginning and end, but show flawed character that overcomes some obstacle to arrive at desired idea
- Reluctant to change to be empowered.
- Overcoming reluctance.
- Change and setbacks
- Start with some perceived conflict or imbalance that is resolved by your presentation

## What is versus what could be 
- Compare and contrast for the middle
- End with call to action that is specific and put the carrot at the end for inspiration

## Target your audience, think about what they like and care about and link it to your idea
- Create common ground through shared experiences, common goals, qualifications
- know the hero, know the mentor

## Map out the journey
- use a big idea: articulate your unique point of view, must convey what's at stake (why they care), must be a complete sentence
- the audience, to adopt your view, must abandon something they know; empathasize with their sacrifice and risk
- understand where they are refusing the call (comfort zone, fear, vulnerabilities, misunderstanding, obstacles, politics)
- make the reward worth it: basic needs, security, savings, prize, recognition, relationship, destiny
  - what does the audience get for changing?
  - COMPEL THEM TO CHANGE

## To persuade, one requires ethical, emotional, and logical appeal
- communicating an idea with its opposite creates tension and energy
- what is vs. what could be
- use stories through: people places, things
- (when,who,where) > context > conflict > proposed resolution > complication > actual resolution
- use data through scale, comparing, and context 
- filter ideas aggressively to arrive at only what supports your main idea
- mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
- most presentations have too many ideas, not too few, use the big idea to filter

## Structure
- review the overall structure of the presentations to identify gaps or extras
- structures that have stories built in: chronological, sequential, spatial, climactic
- structures that have contrast built-in: Problem-solution, compare-contrast, cause-effect, advantage-disadvantage
- clear structure, make audience think with rhetoric
- contrast data with analytical and emotional content
- one idea per slide
- turn words into pictures 
- structure conveys message

## STAR moments
- something they'll always remember 
- memorable dramatization, repeatable sound bites, beautiful images, emotive storytelling, shocking statistics
- memorable dramatization: slow and drawn out to illustrate a point
- repeatable sound bites: slogan, repeat words (beginning, middle, end)
- Michael Pollan: memorable dramatization
- pastor John ortberg: emotive storytelling, go back to theme 
- Rauch foundation: shocking statistics
- Steve Jobs: iPhone launch

## Impression
- first impression determines how people will classify you
- they're about revealing your character, motivations, abilities, vulnerabilities
- how you communicate is more important than the idea itself
- reduce jargon
- value brevity 
- people can only read or listen, they cannot do both
- practice and passion makes perfect
- rehearse and get feedback
- changing the world is the only reason to give a speech
- great communicators create movements
- use your creativity 
- be transparent, honest, unique, and don't compromise
