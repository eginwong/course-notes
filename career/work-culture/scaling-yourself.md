- the less you do, the more you can do
- > I just need to stay up late to catch up on work
  - hope is not a strategy
- effectiveness vs. efficiency
  - effectiveness: doing the right thing
  - efficiency: doing things quickly
- suggestions
  - inbox issues
    - triage/classify
    - predefined work
    - work as it appears
    - defining works
  - 4 Ds
    - do it
    - drop it
    - delegate it
    - dump it
  - communication is fault-tolerant
    - dropping the ball is sometimes the right answer
  - psychic weight
  - rule of 3
    - for the day
    - for the week
    - for the year
  - busy == laziness
  - being creative is the opposite of hanging out
  - let it go
  - efficiency
    - sort your list and manage your input streams
  - don't check your email in the morning, because people will reply
  - **don't put energy into things you don't want more of.**
  - conserve your keystrokes
    - if it's long, put it in the wiki
    - email is where your keystrokes go to die
  - pomodoro technique?
  - turn off notifications
  - everything important will find its way to you many times
  - multitasking fails
    - workout + podcasts
    - read + commute
  - remove guilt systems
  **- if it's not helping me to _, if it's not improving my life, it's mental clutter and its out.**
