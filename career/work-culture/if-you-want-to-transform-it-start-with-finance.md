# If You Want To Transform IT, Start With Finance
[ref](https://zwischenzugs.com/2021/07/12/if-you-want-to-transform-it-start-with-finance/)

- start with finance
- address what "culture" problems are there, that is too unspecific
- to get anything significant done requires money
  - for money, you have to prove why this change has value
  - to understand what value is, you need to understand your stakeholders with money
  - to understand your stakeholders, you have to understand their cashflow
  - to understand their cashflow, need to understand the customers/clients AND legal and regulatory changes
- stages in a product
  - I: hero hacking
    - build product for a few big customers to sustain cashflow
    - cash flow: cheap offices, low salaries with promise for growth or fun
      - customers won because product is cheaper than competition
      - money from customers begets better offices and more teams
      - money === more client demand for customization
      - NO REAL PRODUCT
  - II: pseudo product
    - each installation is more or less unique, but sales are good
    - features grow and maintainability is bad
    - schemas change
    - features get built in parallel and are duplicated
    - cash flow:
      - projects take longer and cost more
      - features that are part of the product are not easy to enable for new customers due to integration time
      - quality of software feels low and fixes take time
  - IIIa: we want to be a product company
    - cash flow:
      - sacrifice individual customer delight for greater long-term product strength and consistency
      - customers less willing to buy into the product because feature delivery times are slower and speed of support worse than they are used to
      - either sacrifice customer satisfaction OR build up productisation debt
  - IIIb: we need an internal platform
- stage III is where things fall apart due to competing priorities:
  - 1. customers want new features fast
  - 2. codebases are never merged and are unmaintainable
  - 3. new unifying products are difficult to build and sell
- all these problems are money flow problems
  - business wants a consistent platform but $$$ is hard
    - after building platform, they don't want to pay a team to sustain it
    - heroes still want to fix things by hand for glory
- reality is that finance + hr + execs have gotten used to the project-based money flows adn cadences and not the new revenue model that may take years to gain
- need to quantify benefits of the platform from the start, to allow for transparency and buy-in

SUGGESTIONS
- involve CFO/finance team from the beginning
- explain to finance the reality of what you're doing
- learn the language of finance and talk to them
