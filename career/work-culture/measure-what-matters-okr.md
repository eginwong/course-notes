# Measure What Matters

- no more than 3-5 OKRs per cycle
- key results should balance out quantity and quality, could be 3-5 per O
- achieving KR must end up accomplishing the O
- smart measurable succinct goals
- ensure the Os are significant and impactful
- don't stress about perfect KRs, some come later

- alignment is super important, make one owner and ensure dependencies are called out
- 3-5 company okr and 1-2 personal okr
- measure it all, how can we track license and functionality use?
- authZ sign in rates? Licenses / users tracked? Hours saved in implementation?

- review OkR weekly, if O is dropped, postmortem as to why and how you can foresee next time, note to downstream
- otherwise, easy for drift
- wrap up: objective scoring, subjective self assessment, reflection
- score: how we did, how we might do it differently, worth pursuing? Average of KRs met
- 0.7-1 is success (green)
- 0.4-0.6 progress but fail (yellow)
- 0-0.3 failed to make any progress (red)
- subjective check: we learn how to set goals and align better. Give contextual score

Google's:
- O are what, goals and intent, aggressive but realistic, obvious if achieved, unambiguous, success must provide clear value to company
- KR: measurable milestones, outcomes not activities, talk about end user impact; include evidence of completion 
- differentiate aspirational from committed OKRs
- must escalate if committed OKR is to be missed
- any committed that miss the date require a postmortem
- objective should fit on one line
- use real dates, not the last day of the quarter
