> After all, if you love what you do, it no longer feels like work. Right?
> To be totally honest though, my work still feels like... work most of the time. Sometimes it's enjoyable, but sometimes it's tremendously stressful and tiresome and even so taxing it affects other non-work related relationships in my life.
> Passion or love doesn't have to be part of the work/job equation
> Instead, I like treating work as work and leaving passion out of it. Success in our work may not actually be about finding and following our true purpose.
