# How to Have Impossible Conversations
[ref](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1280033612574801920)

- identify priority:
  - relationship
  - learning
  - changing minds?
- make understanding your conversation partner's reasoning your first goal
  - "no one cares how much you know until they know how much you care"
- attempt to re-express their opinion so clearly that your target says "that's right"
  - THEN REBUT
- ask yourself, "why do they believe that?"
- Lead with curiosity
- don't try to change their mind directly, have them evaluate their thought themselves
  - can you explain to me how you are convinced of x,y,z?
