# Shape Up
[ref](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01)

## Introduction
- how Basecamp does product development
- six-week cycles, no daily meetings
  - work is shaped by a small senior group
    - key elements of a solution before project is ready
    - how much time do we want to spend? how much is this idea worth?
    - narrow down the problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within constraints
- making teams responsible
  - full responsibility to team of designers and programmers
- don't give teams work before the rabbit holes or interdependencies have been solved
  - timeboxed at 6 weeks, no extensions
  - Shaping, Better, Building

## Principles of Shaping
- too much detail stifles creativity and makes estimation harder
- keep problem details at a certain level of abstraction
  - rough
  - solved
  - bounded
- shaping is primarily design work
  - able to judge what's possible
  - technically literate
  - knowledge about how the system works helps to see opportunities or obstacles for implementing the idea
  - strategic and critical of problem and solution
  - a few collaborators, but mainly closed-door creative
- work on the shaping track is done alongside teams in the building track for six weeks
- steps to shaping
  - set boundaries
  - rough out the elements
  - address risks and rabbit holes
  - write the pitch (formal write-up) to summarize

## Set Boundaries
- begin with raw idea and set broad terms on discussion to make it productive
- setting the appetite
  - small batch (1-3 designers/programmers can build in 1-2 weeks)
  - big batch (same-size team a full six weeks)
- appetite is creative constraint on the design process
  - fixed time, variable scope
  - forces work to be done by a certain time
- don't commit to raw ideas but give it space to groom and see if applicable
- narrow down the problem and really solve the problem the user has
- clear expectations and appetites instead of "refactoring" or "redesigning"

## Find the Elements
- have the right people in the room (no one or people who can move quickly)
- questions to ask:
  - where in the current system does the new thing fit?
  - how do you get to it?
  - what are the key components or interactions?
  - where does it take you?
- breadboarding - sketch key components and connections without a specific visual design
  - places: navigation, screens, dialogs, menus
  - affordances: what can be interacted with
  - connection lines: how affordances take user from place to place
  - use words instead of pictures
- fat marker sketches
  - use thick weight to keep details to a minimum
  - for visual ideas, not textual flows
- elements are the output
- work is not a spec and we shouldn't need to over-explain
  - allows designers creative room to work 
- no commitments yet and can walk away whenever

## Risks and Rabbit Holes
- very easy to sync any meaningful work
- different categories of risk (high and low)
- a good way to find holes is to walk through the solution slowly for a use case
- call out the specific cases you aren't supporting either to help narrow scope
- cut back unnecessary parts of solution
- invite an expert
  - communicate that this is only an idea
  - keep the clay wet and avoid using documents or creating a slideshow
    - draw things up and invite them to the shaping process

## Write the Pitch
- goal of pitch is to present a good potential bet
- presentation should include:
  - problem (raw idea/use case that motivates us to work on this)
    - need to spell out the problem clearly to better set the stage
  - appetite (how much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution)
    - prevents unproductive conversations; there's always a better solution
  - solution (core elements, easy to immediately understand)
    - no solution means churn, so shape it up more
    - help them see it by adding a little more visual cue but don't get too prescriptive
  - rabbit holes (details about solution worth calling out to avoid problems)
  - no-gos (specific exclusions)

## Bets, Not Backlogs
- if the pitch isn't specifically revived, it is let go and not looked at again
- lists are decentralized so that if they are brought back, they will always have context and champions

## Bet Six Weeks
- six weeks of work and two weeks of cool-down to prepare for the next cycle
- teams of 1 designer + 1-2 programmers + 1 QA later in the cycle
- betting table includes CEO + CTO + senior programmer + product strategist
- buy-in from the top is extremely important and keeps meeting short and headcount low
- uninterrupted time of six weeks
- circuit breaker of six weeks so if not finished, project is killed
- notify the groups what features are coming in

## Hand Over Responsibility
- assign projects, not tasks
  - no one plays role of taskmaster or architect who splits work
- usually announcements, docs, and marketing updates can go in the cool-down but deployment and testing should occur in the cycle
- give the team the first few days of silence to assess and think out best areas to start

## Get One Piece Done
- make something demo-able within the first week or so
- programmers don't need to wait
- designers should get good enough and then refine

## Map the Scopes
- create status list based on structure of project instead of individual tasks
- can only create scope map after having assessed and worked through some of the unknowns of the project
- scope map is good if communication is flowing and no sense of worry is there from missing a big chunk of the work

## Show Progress
- capture estimates but also at what stage/confidence they have
- hill charts
- don't just use your head but actually code to assess the feasibility of your approach
- focus on the harder tasks first

## Decide When to Stop
- remember to compare current work to baseline approach of customers to get a better sense of value add
  - no need to design the moon if what is done is good enough after six weeks
- limiting scope is not a bad thing, it's necessary
- extend only if all work is downhill and all the work is must-have

## Move On
- after shipping, let customers get accustomed to the change before making any big decisions
- feedback needs to be shaped as well
