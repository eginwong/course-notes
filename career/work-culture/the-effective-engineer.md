# The Effective Engineer

## Leverage
1. how to get more value out of what I do
2. how to do it faster?
3. how to do a higher leveraged activity?

## Optimize for Learning
- compound learning rate for exponential growth
- take 20% of your week for studying, preferably across days because it's easier to fit that in to the schedule
  - read
  - write code
  - write blogs
  - courses

## Prioritize Regularly
- some tasks you're never going to get to
  - TODO: make a DELEGATION list for things you want done but don't need to do yourself
- when working, ask yourself if there is a higher leverage task to be doing instead
- focus on delivering value first and foremost, each and everyday

You are a role model. What are points of feedback to do better?
- communicate more clearly
- respond to interview feedback faster

For each product, just like each technical team, we should know goals and milestones for at least the next quarter and have them defined and agreed to beforehand

- try if-then plans. When visualizing, more likely to perform the action than procrastinate
- revisit priority often
  - try to make estimates and then validate your estimates for those tasks even

## Invest in Iteration Speed
- set up minimal debugging flow
- master your IDE
- communication is key, esp in the iteration loop and when working with others

## Measure what matters
- and don't measure what doesn't
- choose metrics that
  - maximize impact
  - responsive yet robust

## Validate your ideas early and often
