- time === money
- bad time mgmt === stress
- being successful does not mean that you're managing your time well BUT
  - managing your time well will make you successful
- WHY am I doing this?
  - what happens if I don't do it?
  - do the right things not the wrong things right
  - do the ugliest thing first
  - ALWAYS do the things that are important, don't care about "due soon"
- TIME IS THE COMMODITY
