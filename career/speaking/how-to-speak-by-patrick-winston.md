# How to Speak
[ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)

- start with a promise
- recognize collaborators early
- build a fence around the idea
- cycle back to the idea
- ask questions
- well-lit area
- people are inspiring
  - when they demonstrate passion
- writing is good because it's slow enough for people to comprehend
- use props
- slides are for exposing, not informing
- longest pause is about 7 seconds
- for job talks
  - demonstrate vision + having done something in first 5 minutes
    - show problem and how we're different in approach
    - state steps on how you work through the problem to realize the vision
  - conclude by contributions
- being famous
  - you can get used to be famous 
    - but you never get used to being ignored
  - have a symbol that represents you
  - have a slogan
  - have a surprise
  - salient idea
    - idea that sticks out, not necessarily important
  - tell the story
- how to end?
  - final slides
  - leave contributions
  - and what you get out of it
  - can finish with a joke
    - they've gotten used to you
  - salute
    - been a great time, I salute you for your efforts
- don't:
  - use laser pointers
  - add too much text
  - add logos
  - make font size too small
  - start with a joke
  - stand away from the slides
  - recommend collaborators at the end
  - have a slide "questions" at the end
  - have "see details for more"
  - thank people for listening
