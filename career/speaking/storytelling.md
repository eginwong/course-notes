# Storytelling
[ref](https://www.julian.com/blog/storytelling)

- good hooks
  - questions but not the full answer
  - sharing stakes of the story but not giving away the conclusion
  - sharing a shocking truth but not explaining how it's possible
- time dilation
  - merge your identity into theirs and live the story
  - vary speed, volume, enthusiasm, energy, staccato, rhythm
  - PAUSING
- relive the experience
  - your body automatically captures the moment and does all of the above automatically
- amazing stories
  - formative moments; moments of change
  - painful moments
  - moments of triumph and cringe
- consider a narrative arc
  - hero's perspective
  - goals and obstacles that produce change
  - surprising and meaningful moment of triumph
  - lesson that sticks with us
- lean into silence
- charisma is confidence, joy, and love for your audience
