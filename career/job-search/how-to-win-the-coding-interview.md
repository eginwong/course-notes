[ref](https://blog.devmastery.com/how-to-win-the-coding-interview-71ae7102d685)

- whiteboard interview is to assess
  - thinking on your feet
  - under pressure
  - in a room with others
  - verbalize your assumptions and seek to confirm them
  - think out loud
  - don't be afraid to ask for help
  - represent your skills and experience honestly in your resume
- coding on a computer
  - how well can you code *to spec*
  - begin with questions to reduce assumptions
    - (client or server implementation? good/bad input? unicode?)
  - production-ready
    - comments
    - error handling or at least logging
    - avoid breaking at all costs
    - test harness (testing various scenarios, not the same one)
    - easy-to-read, self-explanatory, good formatting, lint-free
  - efficient
    - runs fast
    - memory-efficient
    - stable and easy to maintain
- algorithms
  - [khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
- passing without solving the problem
  - don't give up too easily
  - pseudo-code it
  - list your known unknowns
    - how would you go about figuring it out
    - tell me exactly how you would search online
- practice, practice, practice
