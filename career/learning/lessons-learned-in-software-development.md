- all new lines must be executed at least once
- test the parts before the whole
- everything takes longer than you think
- first understand the existing code
- read and run

- fix the known errors, then see what's left
- assume no coincidences
- correlate with timestamps

## Cooperation
- face to face has the highest bandwidth
