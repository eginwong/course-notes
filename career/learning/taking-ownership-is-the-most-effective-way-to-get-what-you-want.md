- learned helplessness, that they could do nothing to affect the situation
- when we take ownership for elements of the situation, we empower ourselves to effect change

## Take Ownership of Your Problems
- we can blame the environment/scapegoat
  - wastes energy and distracts focus
- can own, which is arguably harder to take responsibility for your own and others' failures
  - we don't control external factors nor the behaviour of others
  - we control our own behaviour
  - removing ego
  - any other explanation reduces our responsibility

## Putting the Ownership Mindset into Practice
- start with acknowledging personal failure and asking how else could things be done
  - how can I better communicate importance and time-sensitivity
  - how can I provide additional info and tooling
  - how can I help others finish their other work to help them focus on the proposed task
  - have I proposed information that my manager cares about most?
  - how might I increase transparency?
  - how might I preempt questions so that I have more space to work?
- ask HOW
- you must take ownership of the negative consequences as ones you're responsible for and willing to live with

## Questions
- Do you have personal experiences with learned helplessness?
- How can I apply the ownership mindset in my day-to-day?
- How can we foster this mindset in the work culture at large?
