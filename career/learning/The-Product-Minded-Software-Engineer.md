> Product-minded engineers donâ€™t settle for getting a specification and jumping to implement it. They think about other ideas and approach the product manager with these.
> They take the time to understand how the business works, how the product fits in, and what its goals are.
> Juggling both the product and engineering tradeoffs and the impact of each is a unique strength product-minded engineers have.
