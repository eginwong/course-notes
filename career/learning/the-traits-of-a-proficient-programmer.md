- competence means having enough exp and knowledge to get stuff done
- proficiency involves knowing why you are doing something in a certain way and how it fits into the big picture
  - challenge is crossing the divide from competence to proficiency
  - don't get stuck in thinking about being an expert as how much stuff you know
  - explains why most people get stuck in higher-level thinking like design patterns
- a proficient programmer is capable of identifying the right and wrong times to talk about design patterns at all
- a truly proficient programmer fits the tool to the job, not the other way around
- tips to grow proficiency
  - explain why you want to do something a certain way, not relying on "best practices" or community guidelines; discuss pros and cons
  - learn fewer things better, and apply them in many different contexts
    - use failures to establish a clear need and learn more tooling when necessary
  - look for examples where others break rules and meet success
    - occasionally break your own rules and see what happens/changes
  - dig into primary sources instead of just reading summaries
  - drop yourself into the deep end in a project you are mostly unfamiliar with and find your way around
  - ask others to explain why they do things but don't just blindly accept
    - demand examples and inquire context
  - pick a small number of specific skills you're good but not great at and then develop competence to an extreme
    - get to the point that you're better at that skill than nearly anyone else you know
