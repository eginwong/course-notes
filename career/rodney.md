# Career advice from Rodney

> [I]'m in solution architect in enterprise application space. Started out as Software Engineer then progressed to team lead, tech manager, and moved on to architecture

> if you want to be tech specialist and excel in that field, you really have to do some side projects using the technologies at home. Either that or you become workaholic (which i wouldn't advise)

> There's many areas within an enterprise Java app that you can potentially specialise in: front end (spring MVC and all those javascript frameworks; services tier (micro services, SOA, and integration), and back end tier (which is somewhat defunct in this age, such as MDB, hibernate and other caching/database related tech)

> if u want to be tech specialist, u have to pick one of those 3 areas to focus on
back then, my interests were with algorithms and high performance computing (hence my specialisation is with services tier)
i used to host MMORPG game servers written in Java by the open source community. Did that with a few friends enhancing & optimising the server performance
time moved on, took on team lead role in a biz critical EAI platform and that hobby fell to the wayside. Didn't have much time to upskill as work was demanding with afterhours support work required in the middle of the night
that's when i did my Masters IT on a part time basis just to reinforce my skills and knowledge gained
to be a team lead, you need technical skills as well as a good mix of soft skills. It's a natural progression path, but not the only path
> going back to my example, currently with kids, i've no more time (nor inclination) to upskill to the latest bandwagon of technologies. Microservices, API gateways, cloud computing are all buzz words of the current phase but to me, it's the same stuff that i've seen 10 years ago when everyone hopped on the SOA bandwagon but done things incorrectly
> Masters degree was useful for me personally because i focused learning on non-technical things.I majored in Project Management because i was already managing the delivery of many projects in my day job. It served a great purpose of enhancing and reinforcing, rather than upskilling
> all those technologies are domain (aka product specific) technologies
think of the specialsation options as a matrix
on one axis you have 3 tier architecture; on the other axis you have technology domains
u can be a specialis with products (ie. big data apps like Hadoop, EAI apps like Tibco, ERP apps like SAP)
or you can be a specialist with framework technologies within 1 of the 3 layered architectures. This latter form of specialisation is more of a specialist with in-house software
technically speaking, there's a 3rd axis which is business domain (eg. finance industry, manufacturing, etc)
from a career path point of view, i guess the question you need to ask yourself is: where do you want to be in 5 years and 10 years time?

>some questions that you need to ask yourself:
1. do you like BAU support work or project work?
2. do you have a creative side and like to build things rather than given something to enhance on?
3. which of the 3 technology stacks do you like? UX (front end), algorithms (services), or data (back end)?
