> Clarity is harder because it’s more immediate, and has to be based on what’s happening today—which means you need to confront what’s actually happening today—there’s no hiding behind “lack of vision.”
> Sometimes it feels like we don’t have time to coach the people around us, but medium-term—not even long-term—we don’t have time not to.
> As you are human and can only do so much at once, now comes the question, “What do I do first?”. Answering this question is a balance between impact and time.

- begin with: "How do I create clarity? How do I create capacity?"
- what is happening today? no hiding behind "lack of vision"
  - are we doing things because they are interesting or valuable?
- clarity involves hard conversations/truths, defining several steps ahead
- plan
  - take stock of ongoing projects, purpose and timeline of each
  - clearly define scope of upcoming milestones in current and new projects
  - articulate current priorities/purposes and rationale
  - determine time frames
  - make sure project status is visible and teams have visibility into each other's work
- capacity
  - question is a balance between impact and time
  - communicate big-picture info is helpful to set expecations and uncover new information
  - write down list of ideas, review them with a peer/boss/coach, and take them on 1-2 at a time
  - bottlenecks change, revisit and adjust
