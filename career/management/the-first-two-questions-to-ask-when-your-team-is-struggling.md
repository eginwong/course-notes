- begin with: "How do I create clarity? How do I create capacity?"
- what is happening today? no hiding behind "lack of vision"
  - are we doing things because they are interesting or valuable?
- clarity involves hard conversations/truths, defining several steps ahead
- plan
  - take stock of ongoing projects, purpose and timeline of each
  - clearly define scope of upcoming milestones in current and new projects
  - articulate current priorities/purposes and rationale
  - determine time frames
  - make sure project status is visible and teams have visibility into each other's work
- capacity
  - question is a balance between impact and time
  - communicate big-picture info is helpful to set expecations and uncover new information
  - write down list of ideas, review them with a peer/boss/coach, and take them on 1-2 at a time
  - bottlenecks change, revisit and adjust
