# MANAGERS: WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR TEAMMATE SHARES THEIR GRIEF?
[ref](https://larahogan.me/blog/managers-when-teammate-shares-grief/)

- have a handy simple response ready
  - > I'm so sorry
  - > That sounds incredibly tough
  - > Would it be helpful to talk about it?
  - Thank you for sharing the news with you
  - allow for silence
- don't hop into problem-solving, don't make this about you
- ask open questions instead
  - research what resources your company has for employees EAP
  - > would it be helpful to brainstorm together?
  - > would it be helpful to take a day and talk again tomorrow?
  - > would it help to take the rest of the week off?
  - keep your tone level and body language open
  - don't share details of your own story right now
- mirror their energy
  - nod at the pace they're talking at or slightly slower
  - soft eye contact
  - lean in (a little is fine)
- create lots of silence and space
  - > i'm here
  - > take the time you need
- consider your role
  - you are not a therapist, it's okay to defer to someone else
  - > I am here for you and though I'm not equipped, I want to help you find the people you need that can help
  - steer them back into what you can do if it's too therapeutic
- following up
  - write cards (etsy!) that don't need to have a response
  - send flowers
  - care package
  - > wanted to check in, anything else I can help with?
