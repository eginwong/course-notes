> They’ve quit, and when someone quits they are effectively saying, “I no longer believe in this company”. 
> Boredom shows up quietly and appears to pose no immediate threat. This makes it both easy to address and easy to ignore.

Questions:
- Have you felt these symptoms of boredom before?
- Do you think our culture is addressing the problem? If not, how might we?

- people often leave because of boredom
- detecting boredom
  - noticeable change in daily routine
  - "are you bored?"
  - they tell you and you listen
- for everyone on your team, must be able to answer two questions
  - where are they going?
  - what are you currently doing to get them there?
- if you don't have answers to those questions, you can get them by:
  - keeping an interesting problem in their work life
  - letting them experiment
  - not letting people take too much crap work without recognition and understanding
  - protecting their time
  - aggressively remove noise
  - telling them what is going on, keeping them in the loop
