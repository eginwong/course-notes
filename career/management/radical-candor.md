# Radical Candor
Kim Scott

- Have advisee team skip level meetings once a year
- Be straight with people and avoid gender bias
- Have trajectories for both rock stars and super start
- Care personally, maybe have a KYC meeting to learn motivations and future goals; work with them to write down their important drivers (45)
- Next, ask about dreams at the top of the world, several. Get them to write about what skills and their competencies required for each dream. Ensure dream aligns with motivations
- Finally, set 18-month goals and how they can achieve such and such skills and dreams
