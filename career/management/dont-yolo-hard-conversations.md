> The moment that a human being hears hard news they stop listening. 
> Their first reaction, the first words tell you, are not how they feel. 

- Write down what you are going to say
- Share the writing with a neutral party for feedback
- Sleep on the conversation that you've written down and re-assess
- Their first reaction is purely raw animal and don't take things personally

Questions:
- Talk about a hard conversation that you had, either receiving or speaking.
