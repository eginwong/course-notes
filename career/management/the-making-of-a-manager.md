# The Making of a Manager
Julie Zhuo, book

- great mgrs are made, not born
- caring about the person as a whole makes a difference
- when report is struggling, two questions: skills issue? Or motivation issue? If motivation, what does good look like? Go to skills as last resort
- psychological safety by being human and admitting your own faults
- litmus test: would they work for you again? Can you give honest and critical feedback both ways without taking it personally? Do they bring their biggest challenges to you without fear?
- ask questions during 1:1
- no rude people as they are force dividers
- remind people of their strengths and focus on star performers too
- delegate the hard problems and coach
- consider what option will lead to the best future outcome, not only about feelings
- consider the person but also the downstream cost of having a weak person at the helm
