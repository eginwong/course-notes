## running yourself
- lead, don't manage
  - managing is reactive, drive and set the vision instead
- understand your output
  - you are judged by average output of group so don't take anyone on that doesn't increase the average
- focus on inputs
  - don't let people focus on output because they will only look at the short-term and not have the space to go for the 10x win 
- spend time on high leverage activities
  - if you can influence X many people on the work you do, it's worth it
  - the other example is significant impact on a single person
- optimize your most valuable resource, your time
  - set top priorities for your week and block time as necessary
  - need to block long stretches of time to think deeply
  - batch tasks to avoid context switching

## running your team
- gathering information
  - tap raw info as sometimes, information is lost
- simplify the metrics and objectives
  - use paired indicators to help correct one another
  - simplify the team's objective down to a singular goal
- meetings and decisions
  - explicitly decide which type of meeting you are having ahead of time, with agendas sent out ahead of time
  - 1:1, junior should be setting the agenda and flagging potential problems
  - staff meetings, meeting with all of your most senior leaders
    - covers a range of topics that should at least affect two people
    - decide ahead if democratic, concensus, autocratic
  - decision meetings, gather team to discuss final call, make sure someone is +1 to break aties
  - operational reviews, functional unit presents progress, peers provide feedback and suggestions
- peak performance
  - ask whether this person is capable if their life depended on it
    - motivation (that's on you to give vision or impact) or capability (on you for assigning something they can't do)?
    - should micromanage half and laissez faire half because they should be autonomous but will require help early on
      - depends on the task and person but if risk and conviction are low, let them eat cake
