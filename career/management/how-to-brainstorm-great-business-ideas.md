[ref](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-to-brainstorm-great-business-ideas-ab51c3d51c)

- the basics
  - the problem you're solving (aka the market)
  - the distribution channel to reach customers
  - the monetization model you use to make money
  - the solution to the problem (aka your product or service)
- problem first, solution last
  - solution is the most flexible, so we want to start with constraints first
  - don't run around with a key looking for a lock to open
  - a good problem is one that many people have
    - can do something different from an existing problem with a solution
  - problem should be valuable
  - where are people already spending lots of time and money?
  - don't rule out high-value problems
  - have a customer in mind
- talk about the distribution channels
  - start with 1:1 convos via phone or in-person
  - don't copy big company tactics when you're a small company
  - you need to have a good list of those channels or else you don't know your clientele
- solution should be from first principles
  - start small
- monetization model, charge more
