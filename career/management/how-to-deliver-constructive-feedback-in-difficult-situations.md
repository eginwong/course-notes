[ref](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/the-essential-guide-to-difficult-conversations-41f736e63ccf)

## Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
- helps you to be honest without criticising, insulting, or putting others down
> `When ____[observation], I feel ____[emotion] because Iâ€™m needing some ____[universal needs]. Would you be able to ____[request]?`
- subtle distinctions
  - observation vs evaluation
    - easy to make stories but focus on the raw fact
  - emotion vs thoughts
    - up one's emotional literacy
  - universal needs vs strategies
    - autonomy, collaboration, consistency, clarity, integrity, recognition, respect, reassurance, security, support, understanding
  - requests vs demands
    - make them specific, say what you want not what you don't want, stay curious
- keep message under 40 words to avoid dilution of ideas
