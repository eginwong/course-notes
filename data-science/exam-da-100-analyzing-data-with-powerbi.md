# Exam DA-100: Analyzing Data with Microsoft Power BI
- data is to be
  - descriptive
  - diagnostic
  - predictive
  - prescriptive
  - cognitive
- data analysts' responsibilities
  - prepare, analyze, model, visualize, manage
- PowerBI parts
  - Power BI Service (SaaS)
  - Power BI Desktop
  - PowerBI Apps
  - there are preset apps that pull data for you and allow you to refresh dataset whenever
- Power Query to amass info from different data sources
  - can also import via a SQL query
    - ideally create a view instead, to take advantage of optimizations like query folding on retrieval
  - DirectQuery is ideal because it will not store a local copy re: storage modes
  - performance tuning depends on the type of data source
  - query folding offloads sql manipulation when possible in the form of `SELECT` statements
  - Query diagnostics can also help
  - data preview tools in Power Query Editor
    - column quality
    - column distribution
    - column profile
- Transformation of data
  - transforming when loading in data will save the transformations for the next time that the data is loaded in
  - remove columns earlier to simplify the data set
  - can also merge tables together
    - left, full, inner
  - or append tables togeether
  - M code is used to write power queries
- Data Model Design
  - Fact vs Dimension tables
- Workspace Management
  - can create apps, workspaces
  - can view usage metrics
  - can monitor performance
  - can have development lifecycles (Premium)
  - there's a Lineage view for Premium Pro, for admin, contributor, member roles
  - add sensitivity labels
- Security
  - row-level security
    - static
      - create RLS roles using DAX and add members to them in PBIS
    - dynamic
      - `userPrincipalName()` in the DAX query
- Manage Datasets
  - can toggle data with `what-if analysis` in the Modelling section
  - can have PowerBI gateway for ata processing in a centralized location
    - includes refresh schedule
  - incremental refresh can also select what to store and retrieve based on a datetime; RangeStart, RangeEnd
  - there's an endorsement setting in workspace for dataset to show availability of data
  - for premium or embedded, can get Query Caching per user
  - mark as date table
  - can create data hierarchies
  - M-M can lead to ambiguities, and the same with bi-directional cross-filtering
- DAX
  - calculated columns have a value for each row in the table
  - measures operate over the entire table
  - `CALCULATE` is powerful to create measures
  - `USERELATIONSHIP` allows phantom relationships for measures
  - `TOTALYTD` or `PREVIOUSMONTH`
- Performance Optimizations for a PBI Report
  - start with emptying visual cache
    - create new blank page, save and close, and then try the performance analyzer
    - restart PowerBI Desktop
  - to help, review
    - relationships
      - may have bad ones setup
    - columns
      - delete unneeded records/data
    - visuals
      - don't overcrowd
    - DAX
      - crappy performance
      - add variables?
    - Auto date/time
      - can be turned off in global options if you already have a date time value
  - aggregate data and lose detail to save space
  - can create aggregations in power query or in data source
- Data Analysis
  - can do AI, clustering, outliers, grouping, topN
  - Q&A visual can also be taught
  - decomposition tree
  - key influencers to explain specific breakdown
- Visuals
  - can add bookmarks and buttons
  - cross-report drillthrough
  - edit interactions to minimize performance drag
- Dashboards
  - no filters, visualization, or fields panes
  - single page
  - can add alert rules
    - can only set alerts on specific kinds of visuals in PBIS
  - stream real-time data to dashboard
  - data classification
  - mobile view
- Power BI Report Builder
  - different application for pagination and reports

## Review Questions
- to reduce model size, split datetime column into two
- further redution via group by + correct relationships
- web content tile for a Microsoft Stream video
- profiling occurs on the first 1k rows, which can be modified
- remove columns + select + endswith
- for json, expand records -> convert list to table > expand column
- different environments of data can be toggled via parameter
- cannot change data type for an "at" value to Date
  - rather create a new column with correct date type
- RELATEDTABLE and RELATED should be merged tables
- roles are additive in PBI
- one-to-many, and single cross-filtering
- create one active relationship and one inactive for use in specific queries to minimize model size
- R visual has a data size limitation of around 150k rows
- group type is list for not numeric or date, and bin is
