# Don’t Make Me Think, Revisited, 3rd Edition

Usability: “A person of average 9or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth”.

## Krug’s first law: “Don’t make me think!” 

- Reduce the cognitive load on the user as much as possible
- Self-evident > Self-explanatory > Crap

We can scan pages, not read. Users only see what they want to see - they’re trying to accomplish some goal.

We satisfice because we’re in a rush and low cost of being wrong when we guess

- Use conventions when possible. 
- Visual hierarchies for importance and relations
- Break sections into clearly defined areas, help user ignore unnecessary load
- Use headings, proper formatting to know which heading relates to what
  - use bullets with space in between
  - no walls of text
  - Highlight key terms

### CLARITY TRUMPS CONSISTENCY

### Keep things as mindless as possible

### Omit needless words

## Navigation:
- tells us what’s here
- How to use the site
- Confidence in who built it
- Need Site ID, utilities, search, and sections
- No need to be as subtle w/visual cues as people often overlook in rush
- Print out the page and hold it at length and see if you can quickly identify key elts [site id, page name, sections, local nav, you are here indicator, and search]

#### Needs for good home pages:
- Site identity and mission
- Site hierarchy
- Search
- Teases
- Content promos
- Timely content
- Questions:
  - What is this? What do they have? What can I do here? Why here and not elsewhere? Where do I get started?
- GET THE MAIN POINT ACROSS, EVEN IF IT’S OBVIOUS TO YOU
- Tagline is something that no one else in the world could use except you, 6-8 words

### Testing:
- Do more and throughout. Focus groups for getting the abstract idea across
- Interesting to read a transcript of a usability test

### Mobile:
- Makes design even more about constraints vs tradeoffs
- No hover lol
- Focus on memorability, and learnability

## Takeways:
- Use large low-contrast type or small high-contrast type
